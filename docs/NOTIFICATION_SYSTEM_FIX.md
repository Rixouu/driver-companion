# üîî Notification System Fix & Testing

## üö® **Problem Identified**

The notification system was not working due to a **user ID mismatch**:

1. **Notifications were being created** with placeholder user ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
2. **UI was fetching notifications** for the actual logged-in user: `6e91dac5-1eb1-4357-8b08-8f8ef8803c9b`
3. **No match = No notifications displayed** in the notification bell
4. **Email sending** was also broken due to missing user context

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Fixed User ID Logic**
- Updated `createAdminNotification` function in `supabase/functions/scheduled-notifications/index.ts`
- Now dynamically fetches the correct admin user ID from the profiles table
- Falls back to the correct hardcoded ID if profile lookup fails

### 2. **Removed BCC for Testing**
- Temporarily removed `booking@japandriver.com` from BCC list in email sending
- This allows testing without sending emails to the production address

### 3. **Created Comprehensive Testing System**

#### **Test API Endpoints:**
- `/api/test-notifications` - Basic notification and email tests
- `/api/test-booking-reminder` - Realistic booking reminder tests

#### **Test Page:**
- `/test-notifications` - Interactive testing interface

## üß™ **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Access Test Page**
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/test-notifications`

### **Step 2: Fix Existing Notifications**
1. Click **"Fix Existing Notifications"** to update any existing notifications with the correct user ID
2. This will fix the notifications that were created with the wrong user ID

### **Step 3: Test Notification Display**
1. Click **"Create Test Notification"** or **"Create Booking Reminder"**
2. Go back to the main dashboard
3. Check if notifications appear in the notification bell icon

### **Step 4: Test Email Sending**
1. Click **"Send Test Email"** or **"Send Trip Reminder Email"**
2. Check your email inbox for the test emails

### **Step 5: Test Complete Booking Reminders**
1. Click **"Trigger 24h Reminder"** - Creates notification + sends email
2. Click **"Trigger 2h Reminder"** - Creates urgent notification + sends email
3. Verify both notification display and email delivery

## üîß **Files Modified**

### **Core Fixes:**
- `supabase/functions/scheduled-notifications/index.ts` - Fixed user ID logic and removed BCC
- `app/api/test-notifications/route.ts` - Basic testing API
- `app/api/test-booking-reminder/route.ts` - Booking reminder testing API
- `app/test-notifications/page.tsx` - Interactive test interface

### **Key Changes:**
1. **Dynamic User ID Resolution:**
   ```typescript
   // Get the actual admin user ID from the profiles table
   const { data: adminProfile } = await supabase
     .from('profiles')
     .select('id')
     .eq('email', 'admin.rixou@gmail.com')
     .single()
   ```

2. **Removed BCC for Testing:**
   ```typescript
   bcc: [
     creator.email,
     booking.drivers.email
     // 'booking@japandriver.com' // Removed for testing
   ],
   ```

## üìä **Test Results Expected**

### **Notification Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Notifications should appear in the notification bell
- ‚úÖ Notification count should update correctly
- ‚úÖ Notifications should be marked as read when clicked

### **Email Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Test emails should be delivered to your inbox
- ‚úÖ Trip reminder emails should have proper formatting
- ‚úÖ No emails should be sent to booking@japandriver.com during testing

### **Booking Reminder Tests:**
- ‚úÖ 24h reminders should create notifications with "tomorrow" context
- ‚úÖ 2h reminders should create urgent notifications
- ‚úÖ Both should send corresponding emails

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Testing**

### **1. Re-enable BCC (After Testing)**
Once testing is complete, re-enable the BCC to booking@japandriver.com:

```typescript
bcc: [
  creator.email,
  booking.drivers.email,
  'booking@japandriver.com' // Re-enable for production
],
```

### **2. Test with Real Bookings**
- Create actual bookings in the system
- Verify that notifications are created with the correct user ID
- Test the scheduled notification system

### **3. Monitor Production**
- Check that notifications appear correctly for all users
- Verify email delivery to all recipients
- Monitor the notification bell functionality

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Notifications Still Don't Appear:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user authentication
3. Check database for correct user_id in notifications table
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### **If Emails Don't Arrive:**
1. Check spam folder
2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly
3. Check server logs for email sending errors
4. Test with a different email address

### **If Test Page Doesn't Load:**
1. Ensure you're logged in
2. Check that all API routes are accessible
3. Verify database connection
4. Check for TypeScript compilation errors

## üìù **Notes**

- All test emails are clearly marked as "TEST" to avoid confusion
- The BCC to booking@japandriver.com is temporarily disabled for testing
- The system now uses the correct admin user ID for all notifications
- Real-time notifications should work immediately after fixing existing ones

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

- ‚úÖ Notifications appear in the notification bell
- ‚úÖ Email notifications are delivered
- ‚úÖ Both 24h and 2h reminders work correctly
- ‚úÖ No more placeholder user IDs in notifications
- ‚úÖ System is ready for production use
