# Dispatch Status "In Transit" Fix

## Issue Overview
There were two issues with the dispatch status:

1. When a dispatcher clicked "Start Trip" to change a dispatch entry status to "in_transit", the card wasn't moved to the "In Transit" column in the dispatch board.
2. The status wasn't properly reflected in the booking details page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Database Trigger
- Enhanced the `handle_dispatch_status_updates()` function in `db/update_dispatch_triggers.sql` to update the booking record when a dispatch status changes to "in_transit".
- Added proper timestamp updates to ensure the most recent status is always displayed.

### 2. Improved Client-Side Updates
- Modified the `handleStartTrip()` function in `dispatch-calendar-view.tsx` to also update the booking status directly as a fallback.
- This ensures that if the database trigger fails, the status will still be updated.

### 3. Enhanced Dispatch Board Logic
- Updated `createDispatchEntriesFromBookings()` in `dispatch-board.tsx` to preserve the "in_transit" status when refreshing the board.
- This prevents the dispatch status from reverting if the booking status is still "confirmed".

### 4. More Reliable Status Checking
- Improved the status fetching in `booking-details-content.tsx` to poll for updates every 30 seconds.
- Added sorting by `updated_at` to ensure the most recent status is always displayed.

## How to Apply These Changes

1. Update the database trigger by executing the SQL in `db/update_dispatch_triggers.sql`:
   - Using the Supabase dashboard's SQL Editor, or
   - Using the Supabase CLI with `supabase db push db/update_dispatch_triggers.sql`

2. Restart the application to apply all the code changes.

## Testing the Fix

1. Create or find a confirmed booking with an assigned driver
2. Click "Start Trip" on the dispatch calendar view
3. Verify that:
   - The status changes to "In Transit"
   - The booking appears in the "In Transit" column on the dispatch board
   - The booking details page shows the "In Transit" badge

## Technical Details

The main reason for the issue was that the database trigger wasn't updating the booking status when a dispatch was marked as "in_transit", and the client code wasn't properly preserving the "in_transit" status across refreshes.

The changes ensure that:
- The database keeps booking and dispatch statuses in sync
- The UI correctly reflects the status in all views
- Status changes persist through reloads and refreshes
