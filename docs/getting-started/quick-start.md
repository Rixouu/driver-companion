## 📊 **Verify It's Working**

### Test Email Sending

# After: 8-15 seconds, reliable

curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/quotations/send-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","quotation_id":"123"}'
```

### Check Cache Performance
```bash
npm run cache:stats
