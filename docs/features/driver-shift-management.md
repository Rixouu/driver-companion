# Driver Shift Management

## Overview

The Driver Shift Management feature provides a comprehensive calendar-based view of driver schedules, shift assignments, and booking allocations. It allows dispatchers and managers to visualize and manage driver availability, assign bookings, and track shift utilization across days, weeks, and months.

## Features

### 1. **Shift Schedule Grid**
- Calendar-style grid layout with drivers in rows and dates in columns
- Color-coded cells indicating booking status and shift type
- Multi-select date range (day, week, month views)
- Real-time updates when bookings are assigned/reassigned

### 2. **Driver Management**
- View all active drivers and their schedules
- Filter by driver name, status, or team
- Quick access to driver profiles and contact information

### 3. **Booking Assignment**
- Drag-and-drop bookings between drivers
- Visual conflict detection (overlapping times)
- Automatic availability checking
- Bulk assignment capabilities

### 4. **Shift Planning**
- Create and manage driver shifts
- Define shift types (regular, overtime, on-call, split)
- Set shift start/end times
- Track shift status (scheduled, active, completed, cancelled)

### 5. **Visual Indicators**
- **Color Coding**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Confirmed/Completed bookings
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Pending bookings
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Urgent/Priority bookings
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Day trips/Special services
  - âšª Gray: Cancelled bookings
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple: Overtime shifts

### 6. **Analytics & Reporting**
- Total hours worked per driver
- Booking count per shift
- Revenue generated per driver
- Shift utilization rates
- Monthly overview statistics
