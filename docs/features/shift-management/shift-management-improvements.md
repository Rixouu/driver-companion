1. Click "Create Task" button
2. Select task type
3. Check "Apply to Multiple Drivers"
4. Select individual drivers or use "Select All"
5. Fill in task details
6. Click "Create Task" - creates same task for all selected drivers

### Managing Unassigned Tasks:
1. Click "Unassigned Tasks" button
2. Use search and filters to find tasks
3. Either:
   - Drag task to calendar cell to assign
   - Click "Assign" button to select driver
   - Click "Edit" to modify task details

### Viewing All Tasks:
1. Scroll below the calendar to see tasks table
2. Use filters to narrow down tasks
3. Drag tasks to reassign
4. Use action buttons to view, edit, or delete

### Switching Views:

## API Integration Points

All handlers are now fully connected to the backend API:

```typescript
// Task CRUD operations ✅
handleTaskCreate() - POST /api/crew-tasks (for new tasks)
handleTaskCreate() - PATCH /api/crew-tasks/{id} (for editing, with isEditing flag)
handleDeleteTask() - DELETE /api/crew-tasks/{id} ✅
handleAssignTask() - PATCH /api/crew-tasks/{id} ✅

// Data fetching ✅
loadUnassignedTasks() - GET /api/crew-tasks/unassigned ✅
loadAllTasks() - GET /api/crew-tasks ✅ (via useCrewTasks hook)
```

### API Endpoints Created:
- ✅ `POST /api/crew-tasks` - Create new task
- ✅ `GET /api/crew-tasks` - Fetch tasks schedule
- ✅ `GET /api/crew-tasks/unassigned` - Fetch unassigned tasks
- ✅ `GET /api/crew-tasks/{id}` - Get single task
- ✅ `PATCH /api/crew-tasks/{id}` - Update task (including assignment)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/crew-tasks/{id}` - Delete task

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for even more functionality:
1. **Task Templates**: Save commonly used task configurations
2. **Recurring Tasks**: Auto-create repeating tasks
3. **Conflict Detection**: Visual warnings when tasks overlap
4. **Task Comments**: Add notes/updates to tasks
5. **Task History**: View audit log of changes
6. **Notifications**: Alert drivers of new assignments
7. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly drag & drop
8. **Export**: Download schedule as PDF/Excel
9. **Task Categories**: Custom task types per organization
10. **Color Themes**: Customizable task colors

## Benefits
