# Vehicle Inspection System Improvements

## 1. Error Handling Enhancements

### Centralized Error Handling
- Created a robust error handler in `lib/utils/error-handler.ts` with specific error types and classifications
- Added structured error logging with detailed error information
- Implemented comprehensive error classification based on error types and messages

### API Error Handling
- Added standardized API error responses in `lib/utils/api-error-handler.ts`
- Mapping error types to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Created utility functions for API route error handling

### Error Boundary Component
- Improved error boundary component in `components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`
- Added support for different error types with appropriate UI rendering
- Implemented retry functionality for recoverable errors

### Async Operation Error Handling
- Created `useAsync` and `useSafeAsync` hooks in `hooks/use-async.ts`
- Added automatic error handling for asynchronous operations
- Implemented loading and error states for data fetching operations

## 2. Real-time Updates

### Realtime Service
- Created a realtime service in `lib/services/realtime.ts` for Supabase subscriptions
- Added support for different event types (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Implemented utilities for creating filter expressions

### Realtime React Hooks
- Implemented `useRealtimeRecord` and `useRealtimeCollection` hooks in `hooks/use-realtime.ts`
- Added specialized hooks for inspections and inspection items
- Support for initial data fetching and real-time updates

### UI Components
- Created `InspectionLiveStatus` component to demonstrate real-time updates
- Added toast notifications for real-time status changes
- Implemented visual indicators for inspection status

## 3. Deprecated Code Removal

### DB Module Deprecation
- Analyzed usage of deprecated `lib/db.ts` file
- Verified that direct imports of `lib/db/client` and `lib/db/server` are already being used

## 4. Detailed Next Steps

### Fixing Type Issues
- ✅ Added proper type handling in real-time hooks with type assertions
- ✅ Created interfaces for common entities like Inspection and InspectionItem
- [ ] Add proper database type definitions for all tables
- [ ] Update Supabase client initialization with proper types

### Documentation and Guides
- ✅ Created integration guide in `docs/integration-guide.md`
- ✅ Added usage examples for error handling and real-time features
- [ ] Add inline documentation and JSDoc comments to all utility functions
- [ ] Create technical design documentation for the error handling system

### Refactoring Existing Code
- ✅ Created a script to identify refactor candidates in `scripts/find-refactor-candidates.js`
- [ ] Prioritize refactoring based on the script's output
- [ ] Start with high-impact areas like forms and data fetching components
- [ ] Refactor API routes to use the new error handling utilities

### Integration Plan
1. **Phase 1: Core Components** (1-2 days)
   - [ ] Refactor the inspection form components to use error handling
   - [ ] Add real-time updates to the inspection details page
   - [ ] Update the vehicle management components with error handling

2. **Phase 2: API Routes** (1-2 days)
   - [ ] Refactor all API routes to use the API error handling utilities
   - [ ] Standardize error responses across the application
   - [ ] Update frontend code to handle the standardized error responses

3. **Phase 3: Real-time Features** (2-3 days)
   - [ ] Replace polling with real-time subscriptions in all components
   - [ ] Add real-time notifications for important events
   - [ ] Implement collaborative features using real-time updates

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Validation** (1-2 days)
   - [ ] Add unit tests for error handling utilities
   - [ ] Add integration tests for real-time features
   - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of refactored components

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize the real-time subscription management to reduce overhead
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for Supabase client
- [ ] Add caching for real-time data to reduce network traffic

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add offline support with local caching and synchronization
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Add analytics for error tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Create a developer dashboard for managing errors and monitoring real-time activity
