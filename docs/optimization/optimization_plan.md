- **Location:** `package.json`
- **Impact:** High security risk

#### 1.2. Insecure Database Migration Practices
- **Status:** 🔴 Critical
- **Issue:** Manual SQL scripts for database changes
- **Location:** `package.json` scripts
- **Impact:** Data integrity and consistency risks

### 2. Performance Optimization

#### 2.1. Large Bundle Size
- **Status:** 🟡 Medium
- **Issue:** Heavy dependencies impacting load times
- **Location:** `package.json`
- **Impact:** Poor user experience

#### 2.2. Inefficient Database Queries
- **Status:** 🟡 Medium
- **Issue:** Complex queries without proper optimization
- **Location:** `database/migrations/`
- **Impact:** Slow application performance
