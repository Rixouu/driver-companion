# Dispatch Status Update Guide

## Changes Implemented

1. Fixed the UI refresh on the dispatch calendar view when changing status
2. Added better visibility of dispatch status on the booking details page
3. Created database triggers to ensure status changes propagate correctly

## Database Update Instructions

To apply the database changes, use one of the following methods:

### 1. Using Supabase UI

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the content from `db/update_dispatch_triggers.sql`
5. Run the query

### 2. Using Supabase CLI

```bash
supabase db push db/update_dispatch_triggers.sql
```

## Verifying Changes

After implementing the changes:

1. Start a trip by clicking "Start Trip" on a confirmed booking
2. Verify that the status changes to "In Transit"
3. Check that the booking details page also shows the "In Transit" status
4. When the trip's end time has passed, click "Mark as Complete" to complete the trip
5. Verify the status changes to "Completed" 

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify in the Supabase dashboard that the dispatch_entries table has the correct trigger by going to Database > Tables > dispatch_entries > Triggers
3. Restart the application server

## Developer Notes

The changes ensure that:

1. When a dispatcher clicks "Start Trip", the status is immediately updated to "in_transit"
2. The UI refresh is forced with a query parameter to ensure the state is correctly reflected
3. When a trip ends, the "Mark as Complete" button appears and can be used to update both the dispatch and booking status to "completed"
