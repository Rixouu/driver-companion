### Optional Secrets:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- Environment-specific deployment tokens (if using custom deployment)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions are automatically enabled for public repositories. For private repositories, ensure Actions are enabled in repository settings.

### 2. Configure Secrets
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Add the required secrets listed above

### 3. Set up Environments (Optional)
For deployment workflows, create environments in GitHub:
1. Go to repository settings
2. Navigate to "Environments"
3. Create `staging` and `production` environments
4. Configure environment protection rules as needed

### 4. Configure Branch Protection
Set up branch protection rules for `main` and `develop` branches:
1. Go to repository settings ‚Üí "Branches"
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Select required workflows
