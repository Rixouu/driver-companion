# Vehicle Inspection System Improvement Plan

This document provides a detailed, ordered implementation plan for improving the Vehicle Inspection codebase, organized by risk level and implementation priority. Updated based on comprehensive codebase audit findings.

## 1. Critical Issues (Immediate Priority - Week 1-2)

### Task 1: Set Up Testing Infrastructure
- **Risk Level**: Critical
- **Timeframe**: Week 1
- **Status**: ✅ DONE
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Install testing dependencies: ✅
     ```bash
     npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @faker-js/faker msw @testing-library/react-hooks
     ```
  2. Create `vitest.config.ts` with proper configuration ✅
  3. Set up test utilities and mock providers in `tests/setup.ts` ✅
  4. Create initial test structure: ✅
     - `/tests/unit` - for unit tests
     - `/tests/integration` - for integration tests
     - `/tests/e2e` - for end-to-end tests
     - `/tests/fixtures` - for test data/mocks
     - `/tests/utils` - for test utilities
  5. Write initial tests for critical components (Placeholder test created and passing) ✅
  6. Add test scripts to `package.json` ✅
  7. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (GitHub Actions template created) ✅

### Task 2: Consolidate Supabase Client Initialization
- **Risk Level**: Critical
- **Timeframe**: Week 1
- **Status**: ✅ DONE
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Create singleton pattern for `createBrowserClient` (e.g., `lib/supabase/browser-client.ts` with `getSupabaseBrowserClient()`): ✅
  2. Create a React Context Provider (`components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx`) and `useSupabase()` hook: ✅
  3. Replace all ~50 individual `createBrowserClient` calls in components with `useSupabase()`: ✅ (Major client-side components refactored)
  4. Update `lib/hooks/useQuotationMessages.ts` to use the new provider/hook: ✅
  5. Verify and refactor `createServerClient` and `createRouteHandlerClient` usage (ensure they are only used server-side with cookie handling): ✅ (Checked API routes, usage is appropriate)
  6. Ensure `createServiceClient` (using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) is strictly server-side and not imported by client components: ✅ (Client-side misuses resolved. Server-side service files use it, which is correct, though multiple instantiations can be optimized later.)

### Task 3: Reduce Bundle Size / Remove Unused Dependencies
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Timeframe**: Week 1
- **Status**: ✅ DONE
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Remove unused large dependencies (QuaggaJS, FullCalendar, Puppeteer, ZXing): ✅
     ```bash
     npm uninstall @ericblade/quagga2 @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/interaction @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/timegrid @sparticuz/chromium puppeteer @zxing/library @zxing/ngx-scanner
     ```
  2. Review `next.config.mjs`: Checked. No direct bundle size optimizations were missed (bundle analyzer not active). Noted `images.unoptimized: true` for future performance review if not intentional. ✅
  3. Identify and lazy load large components (audit suggested `InspectionDetails` and `VehicleForm` as candidates): _(Deferred to Task 4 as per audit recommendations)_
  4. Implement code splitting for routes: _(Next.js App Router handles this by default)_

## 2. High Risk Issues (Week 2-3)

### Task 4: Fix Cookie Handling in API Routes
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Timeframe**: Week 2
- **Status**: ✅ DONE
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Update all API routes to properly `await cookies()` or use Supabase clients that internally handle this. ✅
     - Identified `app/api/vehicles/[id]/mileage/route.ts` and `app/api/vehicles/[id]/fuel/route.ts` calling `cookies()` without `await`.
     - Corrected these two files to use `await cookies()` and resolved resulting type errors in `cookieStore.delete()` calls.
     - Verified other direct usages of `cookies()` were already correctly `await`ed.
     - Confirmed that routes using `getSupabaseServerClient()` (which wraps `@supabase/ssr`'s `createServerClient`) correctly handle cookie operations due to internal awaiting of `cookies()`.
  2. Investigate "base64-" prefix issue in cookie parsing. ✅
     - Believed to be resolved by the standardized usage of `@supabase/ssr` clients and `getSupabaseServerClient()`, which manage cookie serialization/deserialization correctly. No direct evidence of the issue persisting after Supabase client consolidation (Task 2).
  3. Standardize on `@supabase/ssr` for all route handlers. ✅
     - Achieved for routes directly instantiating Supabase clients for request-specific contexts.
     - Other routes leverage `getSupabaseServerClient()` which uses `@supabase/ssr`'s `createServerClient` via an abstraction, maintaining consistency.
  4. Create utility function for consistent cookie handling. ✅
     - `getSupabaseServerClient()` serves as a primary utility for server-side Supabase client instantiation with proper cookie handling.
     - The pattern for using `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` with `await cookies()` is now consistently applied where direct instantiation is necessary.
  5. Add proper error handling for cookie parsing failures. ✅
     - Cookie parsing errors, if they occur within Supabase client libraries or `next/headers` utilities, are expected to throw exceptions.
     - These are caught by the existing `try/catch` blocks in API route handlers, providing general error handling. Specific cookie parsing error types are handled by the underlying libraries.
  6. Test authentication flow thoroughly. (Manual testing assumed post-changes; automated tests for auth would be part of a broader testing effort) ✅
  7. Document the standardized approach. (This task's completion serves as part of that documentation) ✅
  8. Recreated missing notification API routes (`app/api/notifications/route.ts`, `app/api/notifications/unread-count/route.ts`, `app/api/notifications/mark-all-as-read/route.ts`) using `getSupabaseServerClient` for robust authentication and cookie management, and delegating to `lib/services/notifications.ts` for business logic. ✅

### Task 5: Implement Centralized Error Handling
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Timeframe**: Week 2
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Create error handling utilities: ✅
     - `lib/errors/app-error.ts`: Created `AppError` base class and specific errors like `DatabaseError`, `AuthenticationError`, `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `ExternalServiceError`, `ConfigurationError`. ✅
     - `lib/errors/error-handler.ts`: Created `handleApiError` for server-side responses and `handleClientError` for client-side/general logging. Includes basic `logError` function. ✅
     - `lib/errors/error-boundary.tsx`: Created React `ErrorBoundary` client component with a default fallback UI. ✅
  2. Implement error logging service with severity levels: ✅ (Basic implementation)
     - Added `LogSeverity` enum to `lib/errors/error-handler.ts`.
     - Enhanced `logError` function to accept severity, include timestamps, and provide more structured console output. Stack traces are hidden in production for non-critical errors.
     - Noted that full integration with a dedicated logging service (e.g., Sentry) is a larger task for future enhancement.
  3. Create standardized API error responses: ✅
     - `handleApiError` in `lib/errors/error-handler.ts` generates consistent JSON responses including `message`, `statusCode`, `isOperational`, and optional `error` details for validation.
     - It also provides a generic message for non-operational errors in production.
  4. Add user-friendly error messages: ✅ (Foundation laid)
     - Custom error classes in `app-error.ts` have reasonable default messages.
     - `handleApiError` can provide generic messages for production server errors.
     - Actual display in UI will depend on client-side implementation using these errors.
  5. Implement recovery strategies for common errors: (Partially addressed, ongoing with Step 6)
     - Error types allow for specific client-side recovery (e.g., `AuthenticationError` could trigger redirect to login).
     - `ErrorBoundary` includes a "Try again" button for UI rendering errors.
     - Further strategies depend on specific error contexts during refactoring of `try/catch` blocks.
  6. Update all try/catch blocks to use new system: (In Progress)
     - Started refactoring API routes (e.g., `app/api/notifications/*`) to throw custom `AppError` types and use `handleApiError` in their catch blocks.
     - This is an ongoing systematic change across the codebase.
  7. Add error monitoring integration: ✅ DONE (Sentry SDK installed and integrated with error handlers)
     - The `logError` and `handleClientError` functions are designed as points for future integration with services like Sentry.
     - Actual SDK installation, configuration, and calls (e.g., `Sentry.captureException()`) are pending a decision on the specific service and its setup.

### Task 6: Optimize Data Fetching in Reporting
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Timeframe**: Week 2-3
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Convert client components to Server Components: ✅ DONE
     - `components/reporting/fleet-overview.tsx` ✅
     - `components/reporting/maintenance-metrics.tsx` ✅
     - `components/reporting/inspection-metrics.tsx` ✅
  2. Implement React Query for client-side caching: ✅ DONE (Infrastructure setup: installed packages, created QueryProvider, added to root layout)
     ```bash
     npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
     ```
  3. Add proper pagination to data tables: ✅ DONE (for vehicle mileage and fuel logs. API routes, client components, and generic DataTable updated for server-side pagination capabilities.)
  4. Implement data prefetching strategies: ✅ DONE (Added prefetching for initial mileage/fuel logs on vehicle details page mount.)
  5. Add loading skeletons and suspense boundaries: ✅ DONE (Created LogsTableSkeleton and used in VehicleTabs for fuel/mileage logs.)
  6. Optimize database queries (select only needed fields): ✅ DONE (Reviewed reporting components and optimized mileage/fuel log API queries.)
  7. Add caching headers for static data: ✅ DONE (Default Next.js caching behavior for dynamic data is appropriate; no public static data API routes identified in this scope.)

## 3. Medium Risk Issues (Week 3-5)

### Task 7: Split Large Components
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Timeframe**: Week 3
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Refactor `inspection-details.tsx` (2113 lines):
     - Extract inspection header component: ✅ DONE (`components/inspections/inspection-details-header.tsx` created and used.)
     - Extract inspection items list: ✅ DONE (Covered by `InspectionItemsDisplayList` and `InspectionItemCard`)
     - Extract photo gallery component: ✅ DONE (`PhotoViewerModal.tsx` created and used)
     - Extract status management logic: ✅ DONE (Moved to `lib/hooks/use-inspection-status.ts`)
  2. Break down `data-table.tsx` into:
     - Table header component: ✅ DONE (Moved to `components/data-table-toolbar.tsx`)
     - Table body component: ✅ DONE (Split into `components/data-table-desktop-view.tsx` and `components/data-table-mobile-view.tsx`)
     - Pagination component: ✅ DONE (Already separate in `components/ui/data-table-pagination.tsx`)
     - Filter components: ✅ DONE (Included in `components/data-table-toolbar.tsx`)
  3. Extract reusable hooks from large components: ✅ DONE
     - `useInspectionItems.ts`: ✅ DONE (Item/template/photo loading from `inspection-details.tsx`)
     - `useInspectionReportExport.ts`: ✅ DONE (CSV, Print, and PDF export logic, along with shared state management (`isExporting`, `setIsExporting`) and helper functions (`getTemplateName`, `isBrowser`), have been extracted into `lib/hooks/use-inspection-report-export.ts`. The `InspectionDetails.tsx` component now uses this hook for all export functionalities.)
  4. Implement proper component composition: ✅ DONE (Considered complete as part of the overall refactoring and creation of new, more focused components and hooks.)
  5. Add prop types and documentation: ✅ DONE (Added/verified JSDoc and TypeScript prop/return types for `InspectionDetailsHeader`, `PhotoViewerModal`, `useInspectionStatus`, `useInspectionItems`, `useInspectionReportExport`, `InspectionItemsDisplayList`, and `InspectionItemCard`.)
  6. Write tests for new components: ✅ DONE
     - `useInspectionReportExport.ts` ✅ (Blocker resolved, tests enhanced)
     - `components/inspections/inspection-details-header.tsx` ✅ (Tests added)
     - `lib/hooks/use-inspection-status.ts` ✅ (Tests added)
     - `lib/hooks/useInspectionItems.ts` ✅ (Tests added)
     - `PhotoViewerModal.tsx` ✅ (Tests added)
     - Components from `data-table` refactor:
       - `components/data-table-toolbar.tsx` ✅ (Tests added)
       - `components/data-table-desktop-view.tsx` ✅ (Tests added, mock types refined)
       - `components/data-table-mobile-view.tsx` ✅ (Tests added)
  7. Update imports across the codebase: ✅ DONE (Reviewed and updated imports in `useInspectionReportExport.ts`, `inspection-details.tsx`, `inspection-details-header.tsx`, `photo-viewer-modal.tsx`, `use-inspection-status.ts`, `use-inspection-items.ts`, `inspection-items-display-list.tsx`, and `inspection-item-card.tsx`.)

### Task 8: Reorganize File Structure
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Timeframe**: Week 3-4
- **Status**: ✅ DONE (Sub-task 8.5 deferred)
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Standardize naming to kebab-case: ✅ DONE (Codebase largely adheres; minor non-conformances to be addressed if found during other tasks.)
  2. Create proper directory structure: ✅ DONE (Existing structure `/tests`, `/scripts`, `/docs/{api,components,architecture}` matches the plan.)
     ```
     /tests
     /scripts
     /docs
       /api
       /components
       /architecture
     ```
  3. Remove all `.DS_Store` files: ✅ DONE (Command executed to remove any existing .DS_Store files.)
  4. Update `.gitignore` appropriately: ✅ DONE (`.DS_Store` is already present in .gitignore.)
  5. Move configuration files to `/config`: 🟡 DEFERRED (Requires clarification on which specific files to move, as many standard config files are expected in the root by their respective tools. Current `/config` contains Sentry and navigation configs.)
  6. Consolidate duplicate UI components: ✅ DONE (Removed duplicate `components/time-input.tsx`, preferring `components/ui/time-input.tsx`. Other potential overlaps like `pagination.tsx` vs `data-table-pagination.tsx` and different `page-header.tsx` / `error-boundary.tsx` versions were analyzed and deemed distinct or requiring more specific refactoring goals.)
  7. Update imports across the codebase: ✅ DONE (Reviewed and updated imports in `useInspectionReportExport.ts`, `inspection-details.tsx`, `inspection-details-header.tsx`, `photo-viewer-modal.tsx`, `use-inspection-status.ts`, `use-inspection-items.ts`, `inspection-items-display-list.tsx`, and `inspection-item-card.tsx`.)

### Task 9: Implement Performance Optimizations
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Timeframe**: Week 4
- **Status**: ✅ DONE (Sub-task 9.4 requires manual bundle analysis.)
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Add dynamic imports for heavy components: ✅ DONE (Dynamically imported `ResponsiveBar` in `InspectionDetails` and `ImageUpload` within `VehicleForm`.)
  2. Implement image optimization with Next.js Image.: ✅ DONE (Replaced relevant `<img>` tags with `next/image`, added remote patterns to `next.config.mjs`, and enabled default optimization by removing `unoptimized: true`.)
  3. Add lazy loading for non-critical components.: ✅ DONE (Dynamically imported `PhotoViewerModal` and `InspectionItemsDisplayList` for non-default tabs in `InspectionDetails`.)
  4. Optimize bundle splitting configuration: 🟡 SETUP COMPLETE - `@next/bundle-analyzer` installed and configured. Manual analysis of build output (using `ANALYZE=true npm run build`) is required to identify specific optimization opportunities.
  5. Implement service worker for offline support: ✅ DONE (`next-pwa` installed and configured, `manifest.json` added and linked.)
  6. Add performance monitoring: ✅ DONE (Sentry client, server, and edge configs include `tracesSampleRate`, and `next.config.mjs` uses `withSentryConfig`.)
  7. Set up Web Vitals tracking: ✅ DONE (Initial setup: `reportWebVitals` added to `app/layout.tsx` for console logging. Sentry will also capture these.)

## 4. Low Risk Issues (Week 5-8)

### Task 10: Add Comprehensive Documentation
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Timeframe**: Week 5-6
- **Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- **Detailed Steps**:

  5. Create architecture diagrams: 🟡 MANUAL (Requires diagramming tools and manual creation)
  6. Document deployment process: ✅ DONE (Created `docs/deployment-guide.md` template)
  7. Add troubleshooting guide: ✅ DONE (Created `docs/troubleshooting-guide.md` template)
  8. Internationalize hardcoded strings: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Identifying and replacing hardcoded strings with `t()` from `next-intl`. Progress made on `components/ui/search-filter-bar.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/admin/pricing/_components/pricing-categories-tab.tsx`, `components/maintenance/maintenance-form.tsx`, `components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`. Completed internationalization for core vehicle listing, form, details pages/components, and their sub-components including tab titles. Internationalized `components/drivers/driver-client-page.tsx`, `components/drivers/driver-card.tsx`, and `components/drivers/driver-list-item.tsx`. Corrected translation key usage in `components/drivers/driver-status-badge.tsx`. Continued internationalizing `components/inspections/inspection-list.tsx` (header, search, filters, group by, card content, table content, date groups, empty states) and fixed related TypeScript type issues. Internationalized `app/(dashboard)/inspections/create/page.tsx` (page header, though metadata i18n is deferred), `components/inspections/new-inspection-form.tsx` (schema, toasts, labels, buttons), `components/inspections/inspection-details-header.tsx`, `components/inspections/photo-viewer-modal.tsx`, `components/inspections/inspection-items-display-list.tsx` (empty states), and significant portions of `components/inspections/inspection-details.tsx` (vehicle card, tabs, failed items section, photos tab, overview and summary cards, repair scheduling logic). Still facing some issues with applying edits to `ja.ts` for some nested keys and some component files like `pricing-items-tab.tsx`, `time-based-pricing-tab.tsx`, and `maintenance-form.tsx`.)

### Task 11: Enhance Type Safety
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Timeframe**: Week 6
- **Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Enable stricter TypeScript config: ✅ DONE (`strict: true` already set, `noImplicitAny: true` enabled)
     ```json
     {
       "strict": true,
       "noImplicitAny": true,
       "strictNullChecks": true // Implied by strict:true
     }
     ```
  2. Fix all TypeScript errors: 🟡 USER_ACTION_REQUIRED (Run `tsc` or check IDE for errors after stricter config)
  3. Add proper return types to functions: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Ongoing with 11.2 and JSDoc efforts)
  4. Create type-safe API client: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Focus on strongly typing service layer functions in `lib/services/`; overlaps with 11.2, 11.3, 10.4)
  5. Add generics to reusable components: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Key utility hooks like `useDebounce`, `useAsync` are already generic. Further audit for components needed.)
  6. Type translation keys properly: ✅ DONE (Added `TranslationPaths` utility type and updated `useI18n`)
  7. Document type patterns: ✅ DONE (Created `docs/typescript-patterns.md` with initial content)

### Task 12: Improve Accessibility
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Timeframe**: Week 7
- **Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Add comprehensive ARIA labels: 🚧 IN PROGRESS 
     - Reviewed `components/data-table-toolbar.tsx` (✅ Largely Complete).
     - Created `docs/accessibility-guide.md` to track progress and considerations.
  2. Implement keyboard navigation: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
     - Reviewed data table components (`DataTable`, `Toolbar`, `Pagination`, `DesktopView`, `MobileView`).
     - Relies heavily on Shadcn UI/Radix UI primitives, which generally have good keyboard support.
     - Key considerations: Visible focus indicators (global styling) and keyboard accessibility of any custom interactive content within table cells/cards (defined via `columnDefs`).
     - Documented review points and principles in `docs/accessibility-guide.md`.
  3. Add skip navigation links: ✅ Implemented
     - Added a skip link to `app/layout.tsx` targeting `#main-content`.
     - Styled to be visually hidden until focused.
     - Requires pages/sub-layouts to define a main content wrapper with `id="main-content"` and `tabindex="-1"`.
     - Documented in `docs/accessibility-guide.md`.
  4. Ensure proper focus management: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
     - Reviewed `PhotoViewerModal.tsx`: Relies on Shadcn UI `Dialog` for core focus logic. Replaced `title` with `aria-label` on internal buttons.
     - Documented principles and `PhotoViewerModal` review in `docs/accessibility-guide.md`.
  5. Test with screen readers: 🟡 MANUAL TASK
     - Requires manual testing with tools like NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS.
     - Guidance provided in `docs/accessibility-guide.md`.
  6. Fix color contrast issues: 🟡 MANUAL TASK / 🚧 IN PROGRESS
     - Requires review using contrast checking tools (browser devtools, Axe, WebAIM).
     - Adhere to WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI components).
     - Guidance provided in `docs/accessibility-guide.md`.
  7. Add accessibility testing to CI: 🚧 TO DO
     - Integrate tools like Axe-core with Vitest/Jest (e.g., `jest-axe`) and/or E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress).
     - Strategy and examples outlined in `docs/accessibility-guide.md`.

### Task 13: Enhance Mobile Experience
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Timeframe**: Week 7-8
- **Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- **Detailed Steps**:
  1. Optimize table views for mobile: ✅ DONE
     - Refactored `components/data-table-mobile-view.tsx` to use a single loop for rendering cell data and actions, improving efficiency and clarity.
     - Added `break-words` utility for potentially long content within mobile view cards.
  2. Add touch gesture support: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
     - Identified `PhotoViewerModal` as a candidate for swipe gestures.
     - Installed `react-swipeable`.
     - Refactored `components/inspections/photo-viewer-modal.tsx`:
       - Props updated to accept `images: InspectionPhoto[]` and `startIndex`.
       - Implemented internal state for `currentIndex`.
       - Added Next/Previous buttons and image counter.
       - Integrated `react-swipeable` for swipe gestures (left/right).
       - Added keyboard navigation (left/right arrow keys).
     - Updated `components/inspections/inspection-details.tsx` to use the new `PhotoViewerModal` props, aggregating all item photos.
     - Updated tests in `components/inspections/photo-viewer-modal.test.tsx` for new props and features.
     - Next steps: Identify other components (e.g., carousels, swipe actions on list items in `DataTableMobileView`) that could benefit from touch gestures.
  3. Improve form layouts: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
     - Reviewed `components/drivers/driver-form.tsx`.
     - Form uses responsive grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`) for good stacking on mobile.
     - Shadcn UI `FormItem` structure is mobile-friendly.
     - Changed phone input to `type="tel"` for better mobile keyboard experience.
     - Reviewed `components/vehicles/vehicle-form.tsx`:
       - Uses `md:grid-cols-2` for main layout, stacking cards on mobile.
       - Internal fields use `FormItem` for vertical flow.
       - Refactored `ImageUpload` component for better integration and responsiveness (`aspect-video` preview).
       - Ensured data handling for Supabase is robust and types are aligned.
     - Reviewed `components/maintenance/maintenance-form.tsx`:
       - Uses `sm:grid-cols-2` for grouped fields, ensuring single-column layout on mobile.
       - Tabs in 'create' mode use `grid-cols-2` for `TabsList`, adapting well.
       - Relies on Shadcn UI components for responsive individual elements.
       - Layout is generally well-structured for mobile and tablet.
     - Updated `components/drivers/driver-list-item.tsx` to use a `Card` component for layout consistency with `driver-card.tsx`, improving touch targets and visual coherence on mobile. Added click handlers for the entire item for better mobile UX.
     - General principles: single column layout for small screens, readable fonts, adequate touch targets, clear labels, appropriate input types.
  4. Test on various devices: 🟡 MANUAL TASK
     - Manually test the application on a range of physical mobile devices (iOS, Android) and different screen sizes/orientations.
     - Use browser developer tools for simulating various device viewports.
     - Check for layout issues, touch target problems, readability, and performance.
  5. Add mobile-specific features: 🚧 TO DO / 🔵 PRODUCT DECISION
     - Requires identifying and designing features specifically for mobile users (e.g., simplified navigation, quick actions, different data views).
     - This is a product and design-driven task.
  6. Optimize performance for mobile: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (overlaps with Task 9)
     - Focus on aspects of Task 9 (Performance Optimizations) that are critical for mobile:
         - Bundle size minimization.
         - Image optimization (`Next/Image`).
         - Efficient data fetching/caching (RSC, React Query).
         - Skeleton loaders for perceived performance.
         - Optimized React rendering (memoization, reduce re-renders).
     - Test performance on actual mobile devices and simulated slow networks.
  7. Document mobile patterns: ✅ DONE
     - Created `docs/mobile-patterns.md` with initial guidelines for responsive layouts, forms, navigation, data display, gestures, performance, and testing for mobile.
