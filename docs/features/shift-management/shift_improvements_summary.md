  - Added support for dragging tasks between different time slots
  - Improved error handling and user feedback
  - Added task data preservation during drag operations

### 4. âœ… Hours Tracking System (New Feature)
- **Issue**: No visibility into driver hours per day/week/month
- **Solution**:
  - Created `HoursTracker` component with comprehensive tracking
  - Shows total hours, task count, and percentage of 8-hour day
  - Color-coded indicators for different hour ranges
  - Supports day, week, and month views
  - Real-time calculation based on visible drivers

### 5. âœ… Driver Visibility Toggle (New Feature)
- **Issue**: No way to hide/show specific drivers
- **Solution**:
  - Created `DriverVisibilityToggle` component

  - "All" and "None" quick selection buttons
  - Shows count of visible vs total drivers
  - Integrates with hours tracking and calendar display

### 6. âœ… Google Maps Autocomplete (Enhanced)
- **Issue**: Location fields needed Google Maps autocomplete
- **Solution**:
  - Already implemented for most task types (charter, regular, training, etc.)
  - Uses `GooglePlaceAutocomplete` component
  - Excludes day_off and special task types (not location-specific)
  - Consistent across all location input fields
