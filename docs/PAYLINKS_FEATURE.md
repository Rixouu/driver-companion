### OmiseClient Integration
The feature extends the existing `OmiseClient` class with standard Omise Links API methods:
- `links.list()` - List payment links
- `links.create()` - Create payment link
- `links.retrieve()` - Get payment link details
- `links.destroy()` - Delete payment link

### Database Integration
- Uses existing Supabase authentication
- No additional database tables required
- All data stored in Omise's system

### Security
- All API calls use server-side Omise secret key
- Client-side only receives public payment URLs
- Payment processing handled entirely by Omise

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your environment:
```env
OMISE_PUBLIC_KEY=pkey_test_...
OMISE_SECRET_KEY=skey_test_...
```

### Supported Currencies
- THB (Thai Baht)
- USD (US Dollar)
- JPY (Japanese Yen)
- SGD (Singapore Dollar)
- MYR (Malaysian Ringgit)

## Future Enhancements
